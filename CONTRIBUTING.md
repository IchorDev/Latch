## Issues
We highly appreciate reports of issues you have experienced with Latch as we want the Latch experience to be perfect. Feel free
to make the issue here on Github or on our [discussion page](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/latch-a-locking-plugin-to-protect-your-containers/16508?u=meronat),
just please make sure to include as much information as possible. We appreciate seeing the Sponge version, the Latch version, and
a detailed description of the problem. If a screenshot is applicable, they can be immensely helpful as well.

## Feature Requests
These are my favorite thing as often there is some great idea we missed. Simply try to make sure we do not already offer your
desired feature then make an issue here on Github and include as much information as possible. We will do our best to provide feedback
on your suggestion and get it into Latch as fast as possible if we deem it a suiting idea.

## Pull Requests
We welcome pull requests for features, bugfixes, and more of any size. We will work with you to get it merged as fast as possible,
but we just have a few guidelines that we'd appreciate you follow for the most part. Don't worry about following them exactly, the
important part is the content.

We will eventually include more information about our different systems as we flesh them out more. For now if you have questions
feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NzfKazX). Make sure to use the Gradle task `updateLicenses` when you create new
classes as that will automatically add our license to the file. Feel free to add yourself to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file as well,
including some information about what you added.

Here is a simple style guide to loosely follow though:

### Code Style and Conventions

For the most part we try to follow the [Sponge Code Style](https://docs.spongepowered.org/master/en/contributing/implementation/codestyle.html)
which is based off of [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for ease of use.
