Many people have helped to make Latch become what it is, so thank you to them.
We hope this list continues to grow as the plugin does. If you make a pull
request feel free to add yourself as well.

## Nighteyes604 and Meronat

The two main developers of the plugin. They have done most of the work and
continue to maintain and create this locking suite. Together they have a lot of
goals for the plugin and are excited to continue working on it. Nighteyes604 does
most of the work in all honesty, so thank him.

as possible. So many thanks to them.
